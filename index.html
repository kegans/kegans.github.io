    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hi ! I currently work as a CONTRACT Beta Writer/Editor with Big Fish Games. This past year,
      I earned a B.S. in Marketing at Portland State University. My interests are in digital 
      marketing, technology, and multimedia. Along with my current game industry experience, I've 
      coordinated media productions, participated in a couple hackathons, and managed an online 
      ad campaign.<br><br> 
      
      I have a passion for media, technology, and lifelong learning. With a background and 
      experience in multimedia and marketing, I take pride in combining multiple 
      disciplines to provide deeply enriching and enjoyable experiences through innovation, 
      experimentation, and polish. </p>

      <!--I'm fascinated by all things digital and love synthesizing knowledge gained from different
      disciplines. I'd like to be involved in crafting user experiences - whether it be content
      creation, paid search campaigns, or game design and development. -->
