    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hi ! I'm currently studying programming and database management. I earned a BS in
      Marketing from Portland State University and have worked for over two years in 
      financial services and analysis. My interests include Python, SQL, and multimedia. 
      Along with my financial experience, I've coordinated media productions, participated 
      in a couple hackathons, and managed an online ad campaign.<br><br> 
      
      I have a passion for media, technology, and lifelong learning. With a background and 
      experience in technology, finance, and marketing, I take pride in combining multiple 
      disciplines to provide deeply meaningful and powerful analysis through innovation, 
      experimentation, and polish.<br><br> 

      I'm fascinated by all things digital and love synthesizing knowledge gained from different
      disciplines. I'd like to be involved in crafting elegant solutions - whether it be in analytics
      or database development.</p>
